# Note:

### After downloading from DM Apps, the following changes have to be made because Matt does not want to publish ages at this time.
1. Remove the following columns from the **specimen dataset** and the **data dictionary**: 
    - `scale_id_number__numéro_id_écaille`
    - `ager_id__id_de_l'analyste`
    - `SMART_river_age__âge_en_rivière`
    - `SMART_river_age_type__type_âge_en_rivière`
